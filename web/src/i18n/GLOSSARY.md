# The Bridge — English glossary and style guide

This file is **binding** for everyone who writes English UI strings for The Bridge (bridge `web/src`
and dimensio `harness/web/src`). Code mechanics (`t()` / `tc()` / `tr()`, dictionary files, the
checker) are in `GUIDE.md` next to this file — read that first; nothing here repeats it.

How to use this file:

1. Find the Chinese term in §4 (term tables) or the sentence shape in §6 (patterns).
2. Use the **English** column. It is the canonical value for the plain key `t('中文')`.
3. Use a **context variant** only on the surface named in the variants column, through
   `tc('<context>', '中文')` with one of the context ids in §1.15. Never invent a different plain
   translation for a key that already exists — the checker reports it as a conflict.
4. If a term is missing, pick the wording the page’s reference product uses (§3), follow the
   rules in §1, and add a row here in the same commit.

Evidence shorthand used below: **Claude** = Claude desktop / claude.ai / Claude Code English UI;
**OpenAI** = ChatGPT / Codex app English UI (reverse of its zh-CN bundle, shown as `中文→English`);
**Google** = Vertex AI Studio / Gemini; **Apple** = iOS 26 / macOS Tahoe; **Windows** = Windows 11 /
File Explorer; **Android** = stock Android settings; **Obsidian** = Obsidian app; **coined** = our own.

---

## 1. Style guide

### 1.1 Voice and tone

- **Direct, calm, second person.** Talk to the user as “you”; talk about the agent by name
  (“Claude”, “Codex”) or as “the agent”. Never “we”, never “the user”.
  - 需要你批准 → “Needs your approval” (not “User approval required”)
  - 它问了你一个问题 → “Claude asked you a question”
- **No exclamation marks.** Not in success toasts, not in greetings.
  - 收到，谢谢！反馈已经记下了。 → “Thanks. Your feedback has been sent.”
- **No “please”** except when we genuinely ask a favour the app can’t do itself (rare).
  请重试 → “Try again”. 请先登录 → “Sign in first”. 请在系统设置里允许… → “Allow … in Settings”.
- **Plain verbs over jargon.** The Chinese UI is chatty and colloquial (跑、挂着、碰不到、没成); English
  is neutral and short. Translate the meaning, not the slang (§1.14).
  - 在跑 → “Running”; 没删成 → “Couldn’t delete”; agent 碰不到这台电脑 → “Agents can’t access this computer”
- **Don’t blame the user**, don’t apologise (“Sorry” is not used), don’t anthropomorphise the app.
- **State the consequence, then the fix.** “Can’t reach the server. Check your connection settings.”
- **Keep technical words the owner actually sees in products**: “token”, “context”, “compact”,
  “prompt”, “provider”, “endpoint”. Don’t over-simplify them.

### 1.2 Capitalization — sentence case everywhere

Buttons, menu items, tabs, chips, section titles, dialog titles, table headers, tooltips, aria labels
and settings rows all use **sentence case**: capitalize the first word and proper nouns only.

| Right | Wrong |
|---|---|
| New chat | New Chat |
| Show in File Explorer | Show In File Explorer |
| Sign in with QR code | Sign In With QR Code |
| Manage memory | Manage Memory |
| Admin console → Users | Admin Console → Users |

Proper nouns and official feature names keep their capitals: Claude, Claude Code, ChatGPT, Codex,
Gemini, Vertex AI, Veo, Imagen, Lyria, Antigravity, Obsidian, Windows, Android, File Explorer,
Recycle Bin, Task Scheduler, Cloudflare Tunnel, Liquid Glass, Live Preview (Obsidian),
Quick Ask, Local Agent, Bridge Keyboard, UI Automation, Wi‑Fi, LAN, QR code, API key, URL, PDF, ZIP.
**dimensio is always lowercase**, even at the start of a label (“dimensio · Done”).
“agent” is a common noun: lowercase mid-sentence (“Waiting for agents to start”), capital only as
the first word of a label (“Agent browser”).

After a colon inside a label, continue in lowercase unless a proper noun or a full sentence follows:
“Mode: plan first”, but “Offline: can’t reach your computer. Messages can’t be sent.”

### 1.3 Punctuation

| Rule | Example |
|---|---|
| Curly apostrophe ’ (never `'`) | Couldn’t, can’t, Claude’s, you’re |
| Curly double quotes “ ” around names and quoted text | Delete “{name}”? |
| Chinese 「X」『X』 around a UI element or item name → “X” | 点「重试」 → Tap “Try again” |
| Navigation paths: `→`, no quotes | 设置→通用→语言 → Settings → General → Language |
| Single ellipsis character … (never `...`), no space before | Loading…, Save as…, Move to… |
| Em dash — **without spaces**, only for an aside inside one sentence. Two statements → two sentences with periods; label + detail → colon | Scanned. Confirm on your phone. (not “Scanned—confirm…”) |
| Middle dot · with spaces, kept where the Chinese uses it | Goal · Turn 2/5 |
| En dash – for ranges | About 1–2 min |
| Chinese colon ： → `: `; Chinese comma ，→ `, `; 。→ `.`; （）→ ` ( )` | 模型：{m} → Model: {m} |
| No Chinese punctuation or full-width characters in English values | (checker flags them) |
| Keep ＋ only where the Chinese uses it as a glyph on a button | ＋ New |
| Serial (Oxford) comma in every list of three or more, with “and” or “or” (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google and Apple all use it) | Files, uploads, and sharing; Ctrl, Alt, or Shift |

Ellipsis has exactly two uses: (1) an **in-progress** label (“Uploading…”, “Thinking…”);
(2) a **command that opens a dialog or picker needing more input** (“Rename…”, “Move to…”,
“Open with…”, “Import files…”, “Switch provider…”). Plain immediate actions get no ellipsis
(“Delete”, “Copy link”). Placeholders that invite typing also end with … (“Reply…”, “Ask anything”
is the exception because OpenAI writes it that way).

### 1.4 Periods and sentence endings

- **No period** on buttons, menu items, tabs, chips, titles, table cells, column headers,
  single-fragment toasts and single-fragment descriptions: “Copied”, “Saved to Downloads”,
  “Skills · Connectors · Plugins”, “Runs quietly in the system tray”.
- **Period** on anything that is a full sentence in a description, hint, footnote, dialog body or
  banner, and on **every** sentence of a multi-sentence string:
  “Couldn’t delete. Try again.” / “This can’t be undone.” / “Changes take effect immediately.”
- Questions end with “?” — confirmation titles always do (§1.6).
- Never end with “…” just to sound soft.

### 1.5 Errors

Choose by what the Chinese describes:

| Chinese shape | English | Example |
|---|---|---|
| An action the user tried: 无法X / X失败（动作） / 没X成 | `Couldn’t {verb}` | 重命名失败 → Couldn’t rename |
| …with a reason | `Couldn’t {verb}: {reason}` | 删除失败：{r} → Couldn’t delete: {r} |
| …with a remedy | `Couldn’t {verb}. {Remedy}.` | 保存失败，请重试 → Couldn’t save. Try again. |
| A status label / noun: 上传失败 in a list, 连接失败 badge | `{Noun} failed` | Upload failed; Connection failed; Sign-in failed |
| A standing inability (not an attempt) | `Can’t {verb}` | 当前无法回滚 → Can’t rewind right now |
| Unreachable target | `Can’t reach {target}` | 连不上服务器 → Can’t reach the server |
| Unknown failure | Something went wrong | 出错了 → Something went wrong |

Rules: “Couldn’t” for an attempt that failed, “Can’t” for a state that blocks. Never “Error:
Failed to …”, never “Oops”. Put `{reason}` last after a colon; don’t wrap it in quotes. Use
“Failed to …” only in text that is clearly log/debug output.

### 1.6 Confirmations

- Title = the action as a question: `{Verb} {object}?` — “Delete “{name}”?”, “Stop the main service?”,
  “Revoke admin sign-in on this device?”, “Leave with unsaved changes?”
- Body = the consequence, full sentences: “All its files will be deleted. This can’t be undone.”
- **The confirming button repeats the verb** (“Delete”, “Stop”, “Revoke”, “Sign out”), never “OK”,
  “Yes” or “Confirm delete”. The other button is “Cancel”. 确认删除 → Delete; 确认停止 → Stop.
- Reassurance lines: 不会删除电脑上的文件 → “Files on your computer won’t be deleted.”
- Two-step inline buttons: 再点一次删除 → “Tap again to delete” (see §1.12 for tap/click).

### 1.7 Empty states

- 还没有 X → “No {things} yet” (“No files yet”, “No routines yet”, “No memories yet”).
- 没有 X / 暂无 X (a filter or search result, not a “yet” situation) → “No {things}”
  (“No matching chats”, “No transfers”).
- Optional second line tells the user how to fill it, as a full sentence:
  “No routines yet. Tap ＋ New to create one.”
- Bare 暂无 / 无 in a cell → “None”.

### 1.8 Progress, status and results

| Chinese | English |
|---|---|
| 正在X… / X中… | `{Verb}ing…` — Loading…, Saving…, Uploading… {n}%, Compacting… |
| 已X (done state or toast) | past participle — Saved, Copied, Deleted, Uploaded, Rewound |
| 已X {n} 项 | `{Verb}ed {n} items` — Imported 3 items |
| 运行中 / 已停止 / 未启动 / 就绪 / 出错 | Running / Stopped / Not started / Ready / Error |
| 已开启 / 已关闭 (a toggle’s state) | On / Off (never “Opened/Closed”) |
| 已启用 / 已禁用 (an extension, connector, agent badge) | Enabled / Disabled |
| 已完成 (task/run status) | Completed; as a toast or short chip: Done |
| 已取消 | Canceled (en-US, one L, everywhere) |
| 已过期 / 已失效 (link, code) | Expired |

Status chips never end with a period or ellipsis unless the thing is actively in progress.

### 1.9 Time and dates

Two styles, chosen by density:

| | Compact (lists, chips, sidebars, tables) | Full (sentences, tooltips, cards) |
|---|---|---|
| < 1 min | Now | Just now |
| minutes | 5m ago | 5 min ago |
| hours | 3h ago | 3 hr ago |
| 1 day | Yesterday | Yesterday |
| 2–6 days | 4d ago | 4 days ago |
| ≥ 7 days, same year | Sep 28 | Sep 28 |
| other year | Sep 28, 2025 | Sep 28, 2025 |
| durations | 12s · 5m 3s · 2h 15m | 12 sec · 5 min 3 sec · 2 hr 15 min |
| countdown | 4m 10s left | Resets in 2 hr 15 min |

- Clock times: 12-hour en-US with `Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US')` (“3:04 PM”, “Sep 28, 2026, 3:04 PM”).
  Never concatenate date parts by hand.
- Weekdays: Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun (short); Monday … (full). 周{d} {hh}:{mm} 重置 → “Resets Mon 3:00 PM”.
- Periods: 5 小时窗口 → “5-hour window”, 7 天窗口 → “7-day window” (hyphenated adjective).
- Don’t use `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` short style (it yields “5 min. ago” with a period); use the
  dictionary plural templates above.

### 1.10 Counts and plurals

- English has no measure words. 条/个/次/项/台/张/轮/字 disappear; name the noun and pluralize it.
  {n} 条消息 → {n} messages; 召回 {n} 次 → Recalled {n} times; {n} 台 → {n} devices; {n} 字 → {n} chars.
- **Every string with a count uses a one/other object** (see GUIDE). Never write “item(s)”.
  1 次 → “once”, 2 次 → “twice” only in prose; lists use “{n} times”.
- 已选 {n} 项 → “{n} selected” (no noun needed). 第 {i} 项，共 {n} 项 → “{i} of {n}”.
- Numbers: digits always (“3 files”, not “three files”); thousands separator comma (2,000);
  compact counts with lowercase k/M (“1.2k tokens”, “3.4M tokens”).

### 1.11 Numbers and units

| Kind | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| File sizes | number, space, KB / MB / GB | 12 MB, 1.5 GB, over 20 MB |
| Tokens | k/M suffix, no space | 1.2k tokens, 200k context |
| Percent | no space | 45%, 45% used |
| Pixels | no space | 1280px, 390px |
| Frame rate | space | 30 fps |
| Chars | “chars” in dense UI, “characters” in prose | 3,200 / 4,000 chars |
| Durations | see §1.9 | 2h 15m / 2 hr 15 min |
| Versions | as-is | v5.51, 2026.09.27.1455 |
| Ranges | en dash | 1–2 min |

### 1.12 Keyboard keys and gestures

- Key names: Tab, Enter, Esc, Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Space, Backspace, Delete, Home, End, F2;
  arrows as Left Arrow / Up Arrow. Combinations with `+`, no spaces: Ctrl+K, Ctrl+Shift+V, Alt+Up Arrow.
  macOS equivalents only in macOS-only copy: ⌘K.
- In hints: “Tab to accept · Esc to dismiss”, “Send (Enter)”, “Back (Alt+Left Arrow)”.
- Gestures: 点/点击 → **Tap** on phone-only surfaces, **Click** on desktop-only surfaces.
  For components shared by phone and desktop, **rephrase neutrally** (“QR code expired · Refresh”,
  “Select a file”); if a touch verb is unavoidable, use “Tap” (the phone is the primary client).
  长按 → Press and hold. 双击 → Double-tap (phone) / Double-click (desktop). 拖/拖入 → Drag / Drop.
  松手 / 松开 → Release (“Release to create”, “Drop to attach”).

### 1.13 Length budget

English runs 1.5–2.5× longer than Chinese. Budget for a 390px phone:

| Element | Target | Hard limit |
|---|---|---|
| Tabs, segmented controls, chips, badges | ≤ 10 chars | 12 |
| Buttons | ≤ 14 chars | 18 |
| Menu items, settings row titles | ≤ 24 chars | 32 |
| Toasts | one line ≈ 40 chars | 60 |
| Column headers | ≤ 12 chars | 14 |

When over budget: drop articles, use the short variant listed in §4 (“Full access” not
“Whole computer”), move the detail into a subtitle or tooltip. Never abbreviate with dots
(“Conf.”, “Setg.”). Don’t drop the object from destructive verbs (“Delete chat”, not “Del”).

### 1.14 Colloquialisms, puns and Chinese-only wordplay

- Translate the **intent**; drop wordplay that has no English equivalent. Don’t transliterate.
- Chinese mechanical metaphors → the English product term: 挂进输入栏 → “Add to composer”;
  铸快照 → “Create snapshot”; 总闸 → “Master switch”; 收尾 → “Finishing up”; 召唤 → “Hand off to”.
- Humour/greetings: 夜深了 → “Up late?”; 早上好/中午好/下午好/晚上好 → Good morning / Good afternoon /
  Good afternoon / Good evening. Personalized: “Good evening, {name}”.
- Emoji and symbols in the Chinese (⛔ ⏳ ✓ →) are kept as-is and in the same position.
- If a string only makes sense in Chinese (a Chinese example sentence, a pinyin hint, an IME tip),
  write an English equivalent example rather than translating literally.
- Internal shorthand like 菊花 (spinner) or 月桥 (the logo) never appears in English UI.

### 1.15 Context ids for `tc()`

Use only these. Page contexts apply the reference product of §3; semantic contexts disambiguate
parts of speech.

| Id | Surface |
|---|---|
| `claude` | Claude page (incl. single-agent mode and Quick Ask) |
| `chatgpt` | ChatGPT mode of the ChatGPT/Codex page |
| `codex` | Codex mode of the ChatGPT/Codex page |
| `agy` | Antigravity page |
| `vertex` | Vertex page (media + Gemini chat) |
| `dimensio` | dimensio (only for dimensio-only wording; dimensio has its own dictionary) |
| `files` | Workspace page, phone/web file manager (iOS Files style) |
| `explorer` | Desktop file manager (Windows 11 File Explorer style) |
| `md` | Markdown reader/editor |
| `settings` | Settings pages (iOS / macOS / claude.ai shells) |
| `admin` | Server admin console |
| `开关` | The value shown on a toggle: 开 / 关 / 开启 / 关闭 → On / Off |
| `diff` | Review/diff panel verbs (撤销 → Revert) |
| `名词` | A Chinese word used as a noun where the plain key is the verb (应用 → App) |

**One merged dictionary.** Inside The Bridge, the bridge dictionary (`web/src/i18n/en`) and the dimensio
dictionary (`harness/web/src/i18n/en`) are merged into one object and dimensio’s is applied last, so a
plain key that exists in both **must have the same English in both** — otherwise dimensio’s value silently
replaces the bridge one on bridge pages. When dimensio needs a different rendering, give it a
`tc('dimensio', …)` key (example: dimensio’s compact fold-line durations `dimensio::{n} 秒` → `{n}s`, while
the plain `{n} 秒` stays `{n} sec` for bridge settings and the video player).

## 2. Proper names and do-not-translate

Keep exactly as written (case included). Don’t add “the” except where shown.

| Category | Keep as-is |
|---|---|
| Our brand | **The Bridge** (in sentences: “Sign in to The Bridge”); **Bridge** as a modifier or where space is tight (“Bridge service”, “Bridge Keyboard”, “Bridge URL”). The wordmark “THE BRIDGE” only in logo art. Chinese lowercase “bridge” in UI copy → The Bridge / Bridge by the same rule. |
| Our products | dimensio (always lowercase); Quick Ask; Local Agent |
| Anthropic | Claude, Claude Code, Claude in Chrome, claude.ai, Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, Fable, model ids (`claude-opus-5-5`) |
| OpenAI | ChatGPT, Codex, GPT‑x model names, Plus, Pro, Free (plan names) |
| Google | Gemini, Vertex AI (page label “Vertex”), Veo, Imagen, Lyria, Chirp, SynthID, Antigravity, Google Search |
| Other AI | DeepSeek (“DeepThink” is its feature name), Kimi, Qwen, GLM / Z.ai, llama.cpp, OpenRouter, vLLM, Ollama, Depth Anything |
| Platforms & apps | Windows, Android, iOS, macOS, Edge, Chrome, WebView, Electron, Obsidian, Cloudflare, Cloudflare Tunnel, cloudflared, OSS (Alibaba Cloud OSS), NapCat, QQ, WeChat (微信), MIUI, Git, GitHub, npm, Docker |
| Windows names | File Explorer, Recycle Bin, Task Scheduler, Task Manager, This PC, UI Automation |
| Protocols & formats | MCP, stdio, HTTP, SSE, Streamable HTTP, CDP, API, URL, LAN, Wi‑Fi, OAuth, APK, PDF, ZIP, JSON, PNG, JPEG, MP4, WebM, Markdown (capital M), CSV |
| File names | SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, config.json, .mcpb, auth.json — in code style where the UI supports it |
| Code & commands | slash commands (`/compact`, `/clear`, `/chat`), tool ids (`Bash`, `Read`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `WebFetch`), CLI flags, env var names, rule syntax `Bash(git push:*)`, paths, PIDs, port numbers, `{placeholders}` |
| Keys | Tab, Enter, Esc, Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Space, F2 (see §1.12) |
| Language names | 简体中文 always stays in Chinese; English is “English” |

Tool **display labels** are translated (执行命令 → Run command); tool **ids** shown in monospace are not.

### 3.2 Terms that differ by surface

Plain key = the Default column. Other columns are `tc('<id>', '中文')` variants.

| 中文 | Default | claude | chatgpt / codex | vertex / agy | files / explorer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 对话 | Chat | Session (lists, titles, menus); “conversation” when it means the transcript | Chat | Chat; agy prose: conversation | — |

| 正文 | Body | — | — | — | md: Normal text |
| 撤销 | Undo | — | — | — | diff: Revert |
| 应用 | Apply | — | 名词: App | — | — |

Workspace vs folder: **工作空间 = Workspace** (the vault — never write “vault” in the UI, even where the
Chinese says vault — or a project’s working folder as a
concept); **文件夹 / 目录 = Folder** (a concrete directory). **工作区 = Side panel** (the right-hand
dock inside a chat page) — never “Workspace”, to keep it distinct from 工作空间.
